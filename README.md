# About Me:
  Hi, I'm Zach Hoffman, a **software engineering** student with a minor in **mathematics** at Liberty University. I have a passion for solving complex problems, and I actively participate in the university's **competitive programming club**, where we tackle real-world challenges using algorithms and data structures.


   In my free time, I enjoy staying active through weightlifting, snowboarding, hiking, and playing golf. Some of my favorite university courses so far include **Data Structures and Algorithms**, as well as **Calculus III**, where I've deepened my appreciation for the intersection of math and technology.


   Looking ahead, I'm excited to pursue a career in **robotics**, where I can combine my love for mathematics and programming to build innovative solutions.
